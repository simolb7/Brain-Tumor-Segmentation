# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation
Hi to everyone!

The project focuses on developing an advanced system for 3D brain tumor segmentation and visualization using convolutional neural networks and 3d libraries. The primary goal is to provide an effective and accessible tool for biomedical image visualization and analysis, aimed at supporting doctors and researchers in diagnosis and treatment planning. The system enables the generation of detailed 3D models, enhancing accuracy and effectiveness in identifying tumor regions.

The project was developed for the thesis of my Computer Science bachelor.

To run the project you have to locate your terminal in 	`Brain-Tumor-Segmentation\GUI` and then launch `npm run`.
